### Career Counselling

#### Evidence

#### Reflection:

**S:** Although I had a general idea of the career I wanted to pursue, within the IT field, I was unsure of the exact steps needed to achieve it such as what actions to take, what qualifications were needed or how to move forward in that career path.
**T:** I needed to gain clarity on how to set meaningful career goals and understand the steps I should be taking to move forward with purpose. This involved researching various IT career paths, identifying the necessary qualifications and skills, and outlining practical actions to help guide my progress.
**A:** To address this, I decided to go through the Career Counselling module. While reading, I reflected on several key areas that helped me align with the right direction. These included:
- Clearly defining my career goal
- Thinking about where I want to be in the next 3 - 5 years
- Listing the skills I want to develop along the way
- Researching various IT career paths
**R:** By completing these exercises, I gained clarity and direction. I now have a stronger understanding of my career path and feel more confident in the small, actionable steps I need to take to achieve my long-term goals.
